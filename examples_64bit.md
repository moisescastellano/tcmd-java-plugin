Java Plugin examples
======================

The plugin archives are installed automatically, when the .zip is entered or double clicked in Total Commander.

## [DiskDirCrc](https://moisescastellano.github.io/diskdircrc-tcplugin/)

As the original DiskDir plugin, DiskDirCrc creates a list file with all selected files and directories, including subdirs. You can then "navigate" this list with Total Commander as if it was an archive or directory containing the files.

DiskDirCrc also calculates the CRC of the files and writes them into the index file. CRC is an error-detecting code commonly used in digital storage devices to detect accidental changes to data. DiskDirCrc can then **check (Alt+Shift+F9) the integrity of files comparing the CRC in the list**.

## [JavaDecompiler](https://moisescastellano.github.io/javadecompiler-tcplugin/)

This plugin allows Total Commander to both **decompile** and **navigate** java *.class* files. It is a packer plugin, meaning you can "enter" these files as archives. 

**But... a .class file is not an archive, is it?**

It is not, .class files do NOT contain other files. However this plugin "hacks" the TC packer interface so that class files appear to be archives containing all of:
 - a file "classname.java" which you can view (F3) or copy (F5). This java is the decompiled class file 
 - a list of directories representing all the methods, fields, constructors, member classes and interfaces of the class. This way you can have a very quick view of the class structure
 - a couple more directories show the system properties and environment variables (this info is not directly related to the class, but it could be useful)
 
 In the screenshot, on the left panel we have entered to a .class file. The sub-directories contain members of the class. Decompiled class is viewed on the right panel.

The plugin uses CFR 0.152 decompiler as a library, so it does not need any extra executables or processes.

# Original examples by Ken Handel

Now, every java plugin work as an independent (no need to install javalib.tgz) 64-bit plugin in TC64\. They still work in TC32. 

See the 64-bit update comment columns. You can also check the [list of changes](https://github.com/moisescastellano/tcmd-java-plugin/blob/main/changes.md).

All samples by Handel have been cleaned from extra libraries, repackaged and are available at he links below.

Each plugin has a README.TXT with additional notes and included source code in each *.jar file.
