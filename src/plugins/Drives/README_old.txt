Additional Installation Notes:
==============================
At least Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 5.0 is required (I do not test with earlier versions)
Download it from here: http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index_jdk5.jsp

You must have installed additional libraries first BEFORE installing any Java plugin, if not, do it now and re-install.
These libraries are shared between all Java plugins.
To check this be sure that the sub-directory javalib in the Total Commander installation directory exist and is not empty.
This step is done only once, before the first java plugin can be installed.
If javalib is missing install it from http://www.totalcmd.net/plugring/tc_java.html

What this plugin does:
======================
This plugin shows your local hard disk drives as
a file system. This is for demonstration, only. You can do all like in the normal file system in Total Commander.

How to use this plugin:
=======================
Choose Network as the drive letter to be shown in Total Commander and choose "tcplugins.Drives".
Now enter the drive letter of your choice and browse the filesystem.
