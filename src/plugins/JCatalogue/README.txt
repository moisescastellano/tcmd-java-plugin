Additional Installation Notes:
==============================
At least Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 5.0 is required (I do not test with earlier versions)
Download it from here: http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index_jdk5.jsp

You must have installed additional libraries first BEFORE installing any Java plugin, if not, do it now and re-install.
These libraries are shared between all Java plugins.
To check this be sure that the sub-directory javalib in the Total Commander installation directory exist and is not empty.
This step is done only once, before the first java plugin can be installed.
If javalib is missing install it from http://www.totalcmd.net/plugring/tc_java.html
