# Java Plugins

The plugin archives are installed automatically, when the .zip is entered or double clicked in Total Commander. Each plugin has a README.TXT with additional notes and included source code in each *.jar file.

# DiskDirCrc

[DiskDirCrc](https://github.com/moisescastellano/diskdircrc-tcplugin) is the first java plugin of my own.

As the original DiskDir plugin, DiskDirCrc creates a list file with all selected files and directories, including subdirs. You can then "navigate" this list with Total Commander as if it was an archive or directory containing the files.

DiskDirCrc also calculates the CRC of the files and writes them into the index file. CRC is an error-detecting code commonly used in digital storage devices to detect accidental changes to data. DiskDirCrc can then check (Alt+Shift+F9) the integrity of files comparing the CRC in the list.

# Original examples by Ken Handel

Now, every java plugin work as an independent (no need to install javalib.tgz) 64-bit plugin in TC64\. They still work in TC32. See the 64-bit update comment (2021) All samples by Handel have been cleaned from extra libraries, repackaged and are available at he links below.
