Writing lister plugins (version 1.5) for Total Commander

<H1>Overview</H1>
This help file is about writing lister plugins for Total Commander. Lister system plugins will be loaded in lister (F3 or Ctrl+Q in Total Commander) to show special file contents.
<BR>

The minimum function needed for a Lister plugin is:
<UL>
<LI>ListLoad - Tells the plugin to load a file and create a child window for it.
</UL>

The following are optional functions:
<UL>
<LI>ListLoadNext

<LI>ListCloseWindow

<LI>ListGetDetectString

<LI>ListSearchText

<LI>ListSendCommand

<LI>ListPrint

<LI>ListNotificationReceived

<LI>ListSetDefaultParams

<LI>ListGetPreviewBitmap

<LI>ListSearchDialog
</UL>

<H2>How it works:</H2>

When a user opens lister with F3 or the Quick View Panel with Ctrl+Q, Total Commander checks the section [ListerPlugins] in wincmd.ini. For all plugins found, it checks for the nr_detect key (with nr the plugin number). If present, the string is used as a parse function for the file. This allows to load only the plugin which is responsible for a specific file type. If nr_detect isn't found, the plugin is loaded and ListGetDetectString is called (if present). If ListGetDetectString exists, its return value is stored in nr_detect.
<BR>
If nr_detect isn't present, or parsing of nr_detect returns true, the ListLoad function is called. If ListLoad returns a window handle, the load process is complete. Otherwise the next plugin is checked (as above).
<BR>
ListPrint is called if the user chooses the 'print' command from the menu.
<BR>
ListSendCommand is called when the user chooses some other menu command, like select all, or copy to clipboard.
<BR>
ListSearchText is called when the user uses the find or find next function.
<BR>
ListSearchDialog is called when the user tries to find text in the
plugin. Only implement this function if your plugin requires a
plugin-specific search dialog!
<BR>
ListCloseWindow will be called when a different file is loaded, or lister is closed. If ListCloseWindow isn't implemented, the window will simply be closed with DestroyWindow.
<BR>
ListGetPreviewBitmap will be called to show a preview bitmap in thumbnail view. Please only implement this function if it makes sense for your type of images!
<BR>
Note: It's extremely important to create a good detection string, especially if loading of your plugin is slow! With a good detection string, your plugin will only be loaded when needed. If you cannot make a good detection string, then make sure that your plugin doesn't have any static objects defined as global variables! These would be loaded with the DLL! Only create such objects in the ListLoad function!
